# Dynamic metatags in react using node server SSR

To try the demo, first clone this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/osamamammar/dynamic-metatags-react-SSR.git
npm install
npm run build
node server.js
```

Then visit `localhost:5000` in the browser.

You will be able to see the server render each route, and also if you view source, you will see the metatags dynamically generated by the server.
